            <ul>
            <li>Revamped machine learning pipeline for NA’s performance metrics, including repair quality and repair damage. </li>
            <li>Fine-tuned a DistilBert model in Python to process customer narratives and identify repair damage. Reworked repair quality detection with a custom-weighted TF-IDF algorithm for semantic similarity to address locationality mismatch.  </li>
            <li>Performed A/B test with revamped pipeline, concluding over 10% increase in accuracy on ad-hoc labeled testing data.</li>
            <li>Identified and debugged logical errors in 100+ lines MySQL queries to accommodate business logic updates, conducted
              impact analysis quantifying changes in metrics, notifying business with a 3.5% fluctuation in metrics.</li>
            <li>Facilitated weekly meetings between business analytics, operations, and multiple service departments for sync. Addressed their concerns by finalizing business definitions for the performance metrics and aligning them with models.</li>
